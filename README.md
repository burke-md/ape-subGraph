# ape-subGraph

This is an adaptation from a [walkthrough](https://github.com/dabit3/custom-nft-subgraph-workshop) put together by [Nader](https://github.com/dabit3).


While originally the subgraph was based around [Cryptocoven](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5180db8F5c931aaE63c74266b211F580155ecac8#code), I will be building out a graph around BAYC.

Many of the components are not directly compatible and will need to be adjusted.
